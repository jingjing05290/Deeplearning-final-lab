Based on our Magnetic fileds dataset is too large to upload in github which is actually over 3.08GB, so the original data needs to be fetched from Google Drive：https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11FT44XAi-91SJ66sCc3G_BwAX8o__GDM?usp=sharing, the data set we used is the magfield_96.h5.

Specific training and testing results are displayed in Weights & Biases：https://wandb.ai/zhulin010216/VAE%20parts
